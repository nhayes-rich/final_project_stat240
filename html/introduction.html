<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>FEC 2016 and 2020 Spending and Fundraising</h2>

<p>
Our first data source used in this project is the FEC's 2016 and 2020 report on election spending. This data includes a detailed breakdown by candidate, state, recipient / donater, amount spent / donated, and several other variables. From this data we are primarily interested in exploring relationships between candidate raising categorized by the contributorâ€™s information. That is, which employers have employees that donate the most? Which occupations donate the most? Which occupations donate the most frequently? Which employers have employees that donate the most frequently? We are also interested in evaluating how much candidates spend by state. Particularly, which recipients / industries receive the most donations (by amount) from political candidates and which receive the most donations (by count)?

Additionally, we want to subset this data by party and by year in order to identify changes / trends. Which states had higher spending (by party and by year)? Which states had higher average spending? Which states had more instances of spending? Which states had higher donations? Which states had higher average donations? Which states had more instances of donating?

<h2>Kaggle 2016 and 2020 Voting Data</h2>

<p>
Secondly, we consider voting data from the 2016 and 2020 election. This data breaks down votes earned per candidate by state. This data grounds the spending and fundraising data and allows comparison of the money spent to actual outcomes in each state.

<h2>Working Together</h2>

<p>
Finally, we hope to take the FEC spending / raising data and compare it to voter totals for the 2016 and 2020 elections. We hope to identify trends in the data between spending (by categorical variables) and voter turnout. Additionally, we want to identify trends / changes between the 2016 election and the 2020 election. How much does spending or fundraising impact a candidate's likeliehood to win a state? Can we predict a party to win the 2020 election in a given state based on their spending and fundraising in that state and historical outcomes? Finally, how much did a vote cost a certain candidate in a given state?
