<h1>Spending by Party</h1>

<p>
The below map displays spending amounts, counts, and average spending by party (candidate) for the 2016 and 2020 general election. Since we are only looking at candidates that ran in the general election (not the primaries), only Clinton or Biden and Trump are considered democrats or republicans, respectively. The states are colored based on the log of the difference in value. A deeper blue means that democrats spent more, spent more number of times, or had a higher average spending in that state, whereas a deeper red means that republicans spent more, spent more number of times, or had a higher average spending in that state. Additionally, white states are "neutral" states.

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>
Generally, about half of the states have democrats spending more, and a half of the states have republicans spending more in both 2016 and 2020. <br>

We also see that in 2016, in almost every state, democrats made more payments, and in 2020, this the number of states where republicans make a greater number of payments increases noticeably. <br>

In line with the point above with number of payments, in 2016, a majority of the states have higher average payment by republicans. This evens out more in 2020.
