<h1>Fundraising by Party</h1>

<p>
The below map displays donation amounts, counts, and average donations by party (candidate) for the 2016 and 2020 general election. Since we are only looking at candidates that ran in the general election (not the primaries), only Clinton or Biden and Trump are considered democrats or republicans, respectively. The states are colored based on the log of the difference in value. A deeper blue means that democrats received more in donations, more donations, or had a higher average donation in that state, whereas a deeper red means that republicans received more in donations, more donations, or had a higher average donation in that state. Additionally, white states are "neutral" states.

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>
In 2016, democrats fundraised more across almost the entire nation. In 2020, this result is flipped, with republicans fundraising more, though only in states that typically vote republican. <br>

Interestingly, in 2016, republicans had substantially higher average donation across nearly the entire US, excluding some Northeast states (such as New York), and in 2020, this result is completely flipped, with democrats having a higher average donation in almost every state.
