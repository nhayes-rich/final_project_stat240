<h1>Prediction model of the 2020 presidential election results using K-NN algorithm</h1>

<p>
We gather the total amount of raising and spending money in the presidential election in 2016 for the Democratic party along with the results of the party for each state. Then we fit an K-NN model on the 2016 data (which serves as a training set). We try different statistical learning models for our data like random forest or binary logistic regression and K-NN turns out to have the highest accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. With the random forest and binary logistic regression model, we include state as an additional predictor since the historical political landscape associating with a state itself can be an important factor to decide the people's votes. Our final K-NN model has an accuracy of 71% with a sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 100%. The results are shown in the following tab. <br>
