<h1>Mapping it Out</h1>

<p>
The following map allows us to visualize spending and fundraising trends for candidates across the continental United States. You can select between visualizing the 2016 and 2020 general election. For each year, you can visualize spending, fundraising, dollar spent per vote, and dollar raised per vote, and raw vote totals for each candidate, in each state. Dollar spent per vote and dollar raised per vote provide the most interesting visualization as they provide some insight into a candidate's desire to win an individual vote in a given election. <br>
</p>

<p>
Additionally, DC often has values that are much higher than any other state. Thus, for visualization, it is often useful to remove DC from the color domain to prevent it from overshadowing other states.

<h2>Important Observations</h2>

<p>
For example, in the 2016 election, Clinton spent nearly $43 for every vote that she earned in Arkansas, but just 6 cents for every vote that she earned in North Dakota. This likely indicates that Clinton was hoping to eke out votes in Arkansas, but understood that she was unlikely to gain much of a foothold in the typically republican-leaning North Dakota. Similarly, we can see that she spent just 14 cents for every vote that she earned in New Mexico, a state where she was already very likely to secure the state's electoral delegates. <br>

<h3>Trump and "Pass-Through" Vendors</h3>

<p>
Interestingly, in the 2020 election, Trump spent nearly $300 for every vote he earned in Virginia. Upon closer inspection of the data, it is clear that this money was mostly directed to American Made Media Consultants, LLC -- a business with, according to the D&B Business Directory, four employees, under $1 million USD in sales, and no online presence. In total, his expenditures to this business totalled $524,158,040. In fact, in mid-July, 2020, ethics watchdog group Campaign Legal Center submitted an FEC complaint accusing former President Donald Trump of using "pass-through" vendors to obscure $170 million worth of campaign spending. "Pass-through"" vendors are, as the name implies, stores or businesses that political candidates can spend money at that will then pass that expenditure through to its intended destination. This allows political candidates to indicate on required FEC forms that their donation is going to, for example American Made Media Consultants, LLC, effectively obscuring the public from identifying the true destination of the expenditure. A similar story is true for Trump in Virginia in the 2016 election, though to a lesser degree.
</p>

<h3>Biden and "Pass-Through" Vendors</h3>

<p>
Similarly, in the 2020 election, Biden spent nearly $182 for every vote he earned in Georgia. This matches the expected outcome of the election, as the Georgia election proved to be an extremely tight race. However, a closer look at the data reveals $446,219,533 in expenditures to Media Buying and Analytics, LLC, a company with no online presence. Unlike Trump, no such FEC complaint was submitted about this business or Biden's expenditures to it, so it is unclear if the business has a legitimate purpose other than obscuring Biden's expenditures. That said, an article published in Wired in 2021, titled "The Political Advertising Black Box Must Be Destroyed", by J. Scott Babwah Brennen, details that this business likely is a "pass-through" vendor.
</p>

<h2>Problems With This Map, and Any Others</h2> 

<p>
More than $1 billion went through these 2 pass-through businesses in the 2020 election alone, and there's no easy way to tell what businesses are legitimate expenditures. Both Biden and Trump exploited FEC loopholes to obscure campaign expenditures, removing an essential piece of democracy -- transparency. We have no idea what our spending or fundraising maps would look like if these "pass-through" vendors had to disclose their payment destinations: As private entities, these vendors have no obligation to disclose payments. Our maps could look completely different. Thus, when visualizing maps in the following tab, as well as in our analysis of fundraising and spending in further tabs, keep in mind the opaqueness present in the disclosure process.

<p>
Additionally, the FEC requires this information to be included / recorded with every political expenditure / donation, but that does not guarantee that it is, or that it is done correctly. An overwhelming amount of the data is N/A (listed by FEC), NA (a missing entry), INFORMATION REQUESTED, INFORMATION TWICE REQUESTED, or otherwise misrecorded. In 2016, Clinton received $80 million dollars in donations from people with no recorded employer / employee in New York alone (not including N/A, information requests, or other misrecorded data).
