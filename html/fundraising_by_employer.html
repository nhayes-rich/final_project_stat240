<h1>Fundraising by Employer</h1>

<p>The following plot shows the most common employers by donation amount, count, and average donation amount. You can filter the results by candidate and year. Note that average donation is filtered to only those employers that had employees give more than 10 times.</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>
Clinton in 2016 received the most donations from individuals who listed their employer as N/A. It's unclear from the FEC data whether this N/A represents an individual listing their employer as "Not Applicable", or a data entry indicating that the data was "Not Available". We assume that it's the former since other missing entries are left as actual NAs.
